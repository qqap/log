<h1>Google Oauth in WinUI3</h1>

<p>
I was creating an app using WinUI3, the newest app framework Microsoft materialised out of UWP. I wanted to add 'Sign in with Google' to the app, however Google only gives examples with WPF and UWP, so I guess I'll have to figure it out.

<p>
If you know anything about Microsoft, they have created many frameworks that are basically incompatible with varying feature sets, that they soon slowly abandoned without actually deprecating. Anyway, so I guess Google didn't come around to adding it for WinUI3, probably since people just use Electron these days, and serious Windows apps are written in frameworks that are around 20 years old. Even CefSharp, the Chromium Embedded Framework that is still being maintained only supports WinForms (2001) and WPF (2006).
